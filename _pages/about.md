I have always had a passion about technology and its tremendous potential to bring about change from a very young age. It started in  high school, when I took my first coding class and has only grown since then.

Over time, I have also come to understand the importance of utilizing data to make informed decisions. Uncertainty is present in many aspects of life and statistics teaches one how to best make decisions when being faced with uncertainty.  

Additionally, over time I have also built up a strong financial background from my actuarial studies. When making decisions, finances come into play and, generally, decisions are only considered viable if they bring about a positive return on investment.

I wish to use my actuarial, computer science and statistical backgrounds to assist in making decisions which bring forth positive change into the world. 

## Currently

I am working at Momentum-Metropolitan as an Insights Specialist. During my tenure at the company, I have learned how to design bussiness processes, engage with stakeholders, plan and implement change management and build big data models which add business value.

## History

I grew up in Centurion, Gauteng. In high school, I took Accounting, Information Systems, Physics and French as my optional subjects. After I gradauted high school, I went to Cape Town to study at the [University of Cape Town](https://www.uct.ac.za/) and stay there for two years afterwards. In those two years, I worked in the insurance industry as part of the Metropolitan Retail Valuations Department.
