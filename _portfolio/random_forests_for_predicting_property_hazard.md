Analyzed a dataset and predicted hazard scores which were used to identify high risk homes that required additional
underwriting to confirm their insurability. Used H2O.ai and R to perform 10-fold cross validation, fit random forest and
boosted tree models and tuned their hyperparameters with the objective of minimizing misclassification error. Random
forest model achieved a 99.3% accuracy on unseen data.
