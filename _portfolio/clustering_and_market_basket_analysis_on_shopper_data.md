Analyzed a dataset of mouse clicks made by shoppers on a health food website. Performed data wrangling using R and
Tidyverse to convert categorical data into a Jaccard distance matrix. Used K-modes, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
and Divisive Hierarchical Clustering techniques. Identified different customer groups and identified each group’s
purchasing propensity for each of the website’s products.
