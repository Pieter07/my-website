It is often said in life that one should not re-invent the wheel and this is especially true when it comes to code. Ideally, ones code should be structures into generalized components which can be reused in similar situations, but which is still applicable to the current problem.

This process often requires one to be able to generalize and to extract the generalizable problem from one's specific context.
